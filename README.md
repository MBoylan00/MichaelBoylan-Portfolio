# MichaelBoylan-Portfolio

Hello my name is Michael Boylan, I am an aspiring software developer currently studying at Ivy Tech.
In my time at Ivy Tech I have worked with HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and JavaScript and done some work in the Godot game engine.
Apart from studying at Ivy Tech I also work in mobile device sales so I am well versed on the features of Apple products and Android products. 
I will be graduating from Ivy Tech in July with a degree in software development.
