Hello my name is Michael Boylan, I am an aspiring software developer currently studying at Ivy Tech.
In my time at Ivy Tech I have worked with HTML, CSS, Python and a small bit of JavaScript.
Apart from studying at Ivy Tech I also work in mobile device sales so I am well versed on the features of Apple products and Android products.
